# imReading Admin Application

V.1.0.0 DECEMBER 2023
I've been with Goodreads since the beginning, but it got cluttered. Still, I love it for book recommendations. So, I set up my own reading journal using Spring Boot on my VPS. The public front end is at http://marisabel.nl/library via WordPress to match my blog's design. Despite not being a Front End designer, ChatGPT accelerates my design process with quick CSS and JS queries.
## Technology:
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.1.0
- Thymeleaf
- Spring Security 6

## Confetti Cloud API 
The API, along with its database, is hosted on my VPS. You can find the codebase here: {URL}. It serves as a comprehensive tool to manage my data, currently handling books, pages, and menu generation. I plan to extend its functionality in the future, hence the name.
